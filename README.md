## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and folders:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that renders the drawing application.
- `styles.css`: The stylesheet containing the custom styling for the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file with the application logic and event listeners.

## Project Goal

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Use the color picker to select your drawing color.
3. Choose between "One Color" mode or "Rainbow Mode."
4. Select a drawing mode: "Hover & Draw" or "Click & Draw."
5. Toggle the grid on or off.
6. Adjust the pixel size using the slider.
